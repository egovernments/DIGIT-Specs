  description: >
    APIs to create, modify and search measurements for an entity identified through the referenceId. Measurements can aid in assessing progress with respect to the baseline or
      reference values. What is to be measured and units of measurements to be defined in the service that uses the measurement service. Values captured in the measurement service are assumed to have the same units of measurement as the source service. Example: If the Works estimate service has defined a line item in cu.m, then a measurement of that line item is assumed to be in cu.m.
